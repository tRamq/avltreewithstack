# avltreewithstack
c++ program for avl trees with every node holding their own stack for any height changes.


the program reads "Kisiler.txt" file and every line have a one person's name and age information. 
I create one node for every person . When i create a new node its create one stack for node and push 'O' character 
in the stack. I hold height and level variables in node object . ı check them every insert function and sending them to 
recursive function for traversal of the tree and ı detect the changes and pushing characters in their stack.
